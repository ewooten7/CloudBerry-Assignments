# CloudBerry-Assignments
 This repository contains all my Python homework assignments from the Cloudberry Python Developer Training Program. Each assignment is structured to demonstrate key concepts learned throughout the course, including:  ✅ Python Fundamentals: Variables, data types, loops, and functions. ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Problem-Solving: Implementing algorithms, debugging, and optimizing solutions. Web Development with Flask: Creating dynamic web applications, handling user input, and working with HTML templates.
